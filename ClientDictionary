def process_clients(segment):

    This function processes a list of data about clients to prepare for a marketing
    campaign.

    Each client is represented by a dictionary with various fields (see CLIENTS_EXAMPLE
    above). Note that sometimes, some of the fields can be missing, you will need to
    take extra care to handle them.

    This function should return a new list of clients with the following format:

    For each client that have a registered address, we need a tuple that contains
    the following details:
        - full name with title (e.g., "Mr John Smith") omitting any parts that
          are not provided,
        - full name includes title, first name, middle name and last name in
          that order if defined,
        - the mailing address (not the email-address).
    If a client has no registered addresses, they should not be included in the
    returned list.

    E.g., preprocess_client_segment(CLIENTS_EXAMPLE) includes 'Princess Elsa Frost'
    but it should not include 'Mrs Leonnie Lion' because there are no associated addresses in the data.

    So, for preprocess_client_segment(CLIENTS_EXAMPLE) one of the tuples included in the list
    is ('Princess Elsa Frost', '33 Castle Street, London')

    :param segment: list of client records. See sample above.
    :return: preprocessed list of tuples consisting of full name and mailing address.
    :rtype: list of tuples
